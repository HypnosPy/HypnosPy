        Originally from https://github.com/shaheen-syed/ActiGraph-ActiWave-Analysis/blob/master/algorithms/non_wear_time/choi_2011.py

        Estimate non-wear time based on Choi 2011 paper:
        Med Sci Sports Exerc. 2011 Feb;43(2):357-64. doi: 10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181ed61a3.
        Validation of accelerometer wear and nonwear time classification algorithm.
        Leena Choi, Zhouwen Liu, Charles Matthews, Maciej Buchowski.
        Description from the paper:
        1-min time intervals with consecutive zero counts for at least 90-min time window (window 1), allowing a short time intervals with nonzero counts lasting up to 2 min (allowance interval)
        if no counts are detected during both the 30 min (window 2) of upstream and downstream from that interval; any nonzero counts except the allowed short interval are considered as wearing
        Parameters
        ------------
        activity_threshold : int (optional)
            The activity threshold is the value of the count that is considered "zero", since we are searching for a sequence of zero counts. Default threshold is 0

        spike_tolerance : int (optional)
            Missing

        min_period_len_minutes : int (optional)
            The minimum length of the consecutive zeros that can be considered valid non wear time. Default value is 90 (since we have 60s epoch act_data, this equals 90 mins)
        window_spike_tolerance : int (optional)
            Any count that is above the activity threshold is considered a spike.
            The tolerence defines the number of spikes that are acceptable within a sequence of zeros.
            The default is 2, meaning that we allow for 2 spikes in the act_data, i.e. artifical movement
        min_window_len_minutes : int (optional)
            minimum length of upstream or downstream time window (referred to as window2 in the paper) for consecutive zero counts required before and after the artifactual movement interval to be considered a nonwear time interval.
        use_vector_magnitude: Boolean (optional)
            if set to true, then use the vector magniturde of X,Y, and Z axis, otherwise, use X-axis only. Default False

        Returns
        ---------
        non_wear_vector : np.array((n_samples, 1))
            numpy array with non wear time encoded as 0, and wear time encoded as 1.
