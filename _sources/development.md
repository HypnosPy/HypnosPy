# Contributing ü§ù
We are very keen on having other colleagues contribute to our work and to make this as generalizable as possible of a package.
This project came about due to the frustration of not having a centralized analysis tool that worked across devices, so if you
find our project interesting or think you can improve it, please contribute by:

* reporting bugs (how you got it and if possible, how to solve it)
* adding new tools- if you are interested on this please email one of the main developers, we'd love to hear from you
* adding pre-processing pipelines for new devices. The more, the merrier.
* sharing our work with your colleagues, this will allow the project to improve and not die in this corner of the interweb.
* reaching out!- we are always keen on learning more of how you are using/want to use hypnospy
