[sleep_boundary_detector.py](https://github.com/HypnosPy/HypnosPy/blob/master/hypnospy/analysis/sleep_boundary_detector.py)\

**SleepBoundaryDetector** labels the sleep-wake periods on the Wearable.data dataframe using any of the following strategies:
* HR-based algorithm - HR-only signals
* Angle-algorithm - accelerometer-only signals
* Annotation-only - diaries or expert labels

Parameters used:
* *hr_quantile* - looks below that quantile in the daily heart rate ECDF (empirical cumulative distribution function) - specific to subject and day / time period
* *hr_volarity_threshold* - volatility threshold (in beats per minute) for refining the initial sleep boundary labels from the quantile step
* *hr_rolling_win_in_minutes* - number of minutes over which to apply the HR rolling average 
* *hr_sleep_search_window* - adjusts the start and end time when looking for sleep boundaries. Eg. (20,12) will only look betwee 8pm and 12 noon
* *hr_min_window_length_in_minutes* - threshold duration for considering an initial sleep-labelled period as sleep. Eg. if 40, then all periods shorter thna 40 min are ignored
* *hr_volatility_window_in_minutes* - how many minutes to use when calculating HR volatility (epochs for standard deviation)
* *hr_merge_blocks_gap_time_in_min* - if two sleep blocks are separated by less than this period, then they are merged into a single sleep blocks
* *hr_sleep_only_in_sleep_search_window* - only look for sleep within search window (boundaries can not be outside pre-defined times)
* *hr_only_largest_sleep_period* - only keeps longest daily sleep period, if 'False', then naps can be detected too\
* *angle_cols* - columns where the accelerometry data is stored
* *angle_start_hour* - time to start each 24-hour analysis
* *angle-quantile* - threshold of activity below which the angle algorithm initially labels sleep
* *angle_minimum_len_in_minutes* - threshold duration for initial sleep period labels
* *angle_merge_tolerance_in_minutes* - if two sleep blocks are separated by less than this period, then they are merged into a single sleep blocks
* *angle_only_largest_sleep_period* - only keeps longest daily sleep period, if 'False', then naps can be detected too

The angle algorithm was developed by [van Hess et al. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-31266-z)


[sleep_wake_analysis.py](https://github.com/HypnosPy/HypnosPy/blob/master/hypnospy/analysis/sleep_wake_analysis.py)\
[sleep_metrics.py](https://github.com/HypnosPy/HypnosPy/blob/master/hypnospy/analysis/sleep_metrics.py)\

Sleep metrics implemented:
* **Sleep efficiency** - 0-1 - (total sleep time - duration of awakenings) / total sleep time
* **Awakenings** - int - number of awakenings longer than x epochs during each night
* **SRI (Sleep Regularity Index)** - percent - indicates how regular one's main sleep windows are, from 0 (sleeps at random times each days) to 100 (sleep between the same interval each day) - metric developed in [this paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-03171-4)
* **Total Sleep Time** - hours - duration of main labelled sleep window
* **Total Time in Bed** - Total Sleep Time + Sedentary Time detected before and after main sleep window
* **Total Wake Time** - total duration of awakenings during each main sleep window

If sleep annotations such as polysomnography-derived expert labels or subject-annotated sleep diaries are available, they can serve as
ground truth for evaluating the performance of HypnosPy in terms of the usual evaluation metrics:
* *Accuracy*
* *Precision*
* *Recall*
* *F1_score*
* *ROC_AUC*
* *Cohen's kappa*

### **Circadian Analysis**

[circadian_analysis.py](https://github.com/HypnosPy/HypnosPy/blob/master/hypnospy/analysis/circadian_analysis.py)

HypnosPy offers two options for analyzing circadian rhythms:
* *cosinor analysis* - based on [CosinorPy](https://github.com/mmoskon/CosinorPy) methods
* *SSA* (singular spectrum analysis) - based on code developed by [Fossion et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0188674)

Cosinor analysis fits one sine waves or a sum of sine waves to a time series using a least-squares approach. It assumes a given period (usually 24 hours) produces a number of parameters:
* mesor - signal mean over a period. For example the mean heart rate (HR) 
* amplitude - the distance between peak value and mesor
* acrophase - timing of peak value relative to each cycle. For example, this would be the minute / hour of maximum activity, or highest heart rate during a day
It has been the historical method of choice for circadian analysis, as it can work with time series shorter than the assumed period. However, there are some drawbacks. Heart rate and physical activity are nonstationary rhythms whose parameters change from cycle to cycle in ways that are biologically significant, but which cosinor analysis can miss. For example, mean HR can increase during bouts of illness of overtraining. Someone who exercises strenuously once a day, but is sedentary otherwise is different than someone who is constantly doing light physical activities. Cosinor analysis only fits once curve to the entire time series, which limits its ability to analyse intraindividual variation.

[SSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_spectrum_analysis) is a non-parametric method that aims to decompose a time series into a sum of interpretable components:
* trend
* periodic components
* noise
While it has been used less in chronobiological research, it does not rely on a priori assumptions about period, unlike cosinor rhythmometry. Taking the daily peak of the main periodic components produced by SSA produces an acrophase-like metric that is free to vary from day to day according to the subject's activity. For example, if someone exercise at 10am on Day 1, 6pm on Day 2, and 10am again on Day 3, the resulting periods will be 32 hours and 16 hours respectively. Cosinor can not accomodate that variation if applied to the entire time series.

This means that SSA-derived metrics are easier to integrate with sleep labels such as sleep onset and offset. New metrics such as acrophase-onset could prove useful in research studies looking at how the timing of physical activity influences sleep and viceversa.
